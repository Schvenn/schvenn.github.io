<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>PowerShell
Development Speed Run!</b></p>

<p>I'm working on a DLP project for a large corporation right
now, but this is a short-term contract and I will therefore need work after
this is done. So, I'm levelling up some of my skills at the same time. I’ve
started with automation and PowerShell scripting and I’ve certainly learned a
lot. Here’s what I’ve accomplished in the last month:</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Archives">Archives</a>:</b> A utility to backup and restore the current
child directory structure with user configurable settings for basic scheduling,
exclusions and maximum archive retention.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Assets">Assets</a>:</b> A utility to view scripts, commands and
functions within PowerShell, in a contextualized manner, on screen, or open
them for editing. Extremely useful for development purposes.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Caesar">Caesar</a>:</b> A module to expand the basic Caesar cipher
functionality to rotate alphabetic characters within a file by 1 through 25
times and add additional obfuscation techniques to plaintext files for basic
encryption. Files or strings can be accepted and output. Files can be decrypted
and a brute-force method can be applied to sample strings within files, using an
English dictionary to find the most probable match and decrypt the files based
on the results.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Compreschon">Compreschon</a>:</b> A unique encryption technique that goes far
beyond the Caesar cipher, using a user customizable library for encryption and
decryption, acting as an innocuous pre-shared key. Extremely useful for sharing
data or code with optimal security. This is a useful cybersecurity tool for
fast, secure file sharing.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/DecodeSource">DecodeSource</a>:</b> A cybersecurity tool to locally decode
strings or files and optionally save the output. Decodes 10 different
encryption techniques and features a heuristic auto-detection mode to find the most
probable match. Ensures sensitive data remains private by avoiding online
decoding services, which is critical for secure incident response workflows.
This is a must-have for cybersecurity investigations.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/FileViewer">FileViewer</a>:</b> A cybersecurity tool to
view files on screen with search term functionality. Accepts single files, or
can provide a selection menu, can restrict files to just plaintext documents,
can accept an array of files from another source as well as search terms, which
is extremely useful in automation for receiving output from another tool.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/FindIn">FindIn</a>:</b> This cybersecurity tool
started as a basic text search tool, but expanded to include recursive
directory searches, a file selection menu and user-configurable library of
Regex search terms, which currently captures 25 different patterns of PII and other
useful identifiers. This also is a must have for effective cybersecurity investigations.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/GetMyCommands">GetMyCommands</a>:</b> A set
of 4 utilities to display information about user installed functions and
aliases. Useful for development.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/GoodHistory">GoodHistory</a>:</b> A significant
improvement over PowerShell’s native command history by deduplicating it and refreshing
it with only successful commands, removing artefacts such as mistyped commands.
Also features an improved viewer.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/HelpText">HelpText</a>:</b> A module to allow stand-alone
or plug-in help menus for PowerShell functions. Simplifies and standardizes
development.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Logging">Logging</a>:</b> A module to improve
PowerShell logging by instituting archival limits, cleaning transcripts, adding
clear command and response separators and appending error logs to each session.
It also includes an advanced file viewer which sorts by date and includes
search functionality.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Navigation">Navigation</a>:</b> This is the module
that started it all. It comes with several functions to make navigating via the
command line in PowerShell much faster. They include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><b>Goto</b>,
which allows fast auto-completion and directory traversal, featuring a directory
cache.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'>feature for increased speed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><b>Locations</b>, which
allows user-configurable single command jumps to common locations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><b>Bookmarks</b>, similar
in nature to Locations, but provides a menu system of common locations for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'>quicker navigation than
through typing entire paths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><b>Navigation</b>, this
module is so large, that I had to create its own help menu function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><b>Recents</b>,
provides a menu of the most recently navigated directories, useful for fast
retracing </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'>steps during extended PowerShell
sessions.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Reload">Reload</a>:</b> A tool to reload modules,
commands or PowerShell sessions in an intelligent manner, on the fly. A must have
for PowerShell development.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/Secure">Secure</a>:</b> A full-fledged password
manager with AES256 bit encryption and a PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation
Function 2) master password. Includes key and database creation and encryption,
password retrieval, creation and deletion. Since it’s local and doesn’t rely on
external libraries, it eliminates the need for online storage and makes data
compromise far more unlikely than with any other method.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/TCX2CSV">TCX2CSV</a>:</b> A personal project to read TCX
JSON files from sources, such as Strava, extracting data, calculating new fields
and exporting them to a single file, useful for import into personal run
trackers. While very specific, it demonstrates the flexibility of PowerShell to
extract and manipulate JSON data for use in other sources.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://github.com/Schvenn/VTGet">VTGet</a>:</b> A cybersecurity tool for
interacting with the VirusTotal API to retrieve malware analysis data regarding
URLs and files. The file mechanism calculates hashes locally, thereby
maintaining the security of sensitive data and only shares the hash with
VirusTotal for evaluation.</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly been a busy month. I’ve kind of run out
of ideas for new tools I can create in PowerShell, though. So, if nothing new
comes to mind, I might take a breather and move onto improving my Python and BASH
skills.</p>
